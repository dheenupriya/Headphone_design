# Headphone_design
I have displayed a output of Headphone_design using python by text allignment in Python. 

Instead printing some letter in text allignment - I used unicode to print different symbols 
and made the text allignment attractive.

If you want to print some unicode, refer to this following link: https://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/category/So/list.htm
All unicodes are printed by pressing ctrl + shift + U + (unicodeno.)

Instead of typing unicode to generate symobols or emojis - we can copy the emoji from net
and paste it insite print() in python

Check out my code.
Hope you understand and love this code.
Thankyou.
